# 2nd-Workshop-on-Compact-Objects-Gravitational-Waves-and-Deep-Learning
The Workshop on Compact Objects, Gravitational Waves and Deep Learning, intends to bring together experimental and theoretical Astrophysicists, Relativists and Cosmologists in a close collaboration with High Energy Particle Physicists to explore the Universe from its most fundamental particle constituents, to the events that happen at a Cosmological scale. The workshop is particularly focused in providing young Master and PhD researchers state of the art knowledge on Astrophysics, Cosmology and Particle Physics, with particularly useful Hands-On sessions, using state of the art Machine Learning methods, to explore signals of new physics that can span the boundary between Particle Physics performed at Colliders, Relativistic Astrophysics, Strong Gravity and Cosmology.
